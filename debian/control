Description: Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
 Support for the Internationalised Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
 protocol as specified in RFC 5891. This is the latest version of the
 protocol and is sometimes referred to as “IDNA 2008”. This library also
 provides support for Unicode Technical Standard 46, Unicode IDNA
 Compatibility Processing. This acts as a suitable replacement for the
 “encodings.idna” module that comes with the Python standard library,
 but which only supports the old, deprecated IDNA specification (RFC
 3490).
